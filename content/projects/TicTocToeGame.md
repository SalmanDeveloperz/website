This game allows you to challenge an intelligent AI computer in a classic battle of Xs and Os. The board is a 3x3 grid, and your goal is to form a line of three of your markers either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The AI is designed to make strategic moves, so prepare for a challenging match!
